# SpuchSharp

An interpreted statically typed C-like language written in C#.

Written when I knew almost nothing about how compilers and interpreters work so the code and overall desing is awful and there is no user defined types support.

I've made it public because why not, nobody's ever gonna see it anyway but if for some reason you are looking at this, __beware that there is a lot of bad words in the code and TODO files__.

You can look at the unit tests to figure out the syntax.
